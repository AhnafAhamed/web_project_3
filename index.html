        routine? From Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon we're going to take
        you on an exciting journey through some unknown regions of your country.
        Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where
        it all began. You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a
        total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental missions. Partying and
        taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire to
        help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author
        Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite
        book.

          Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an
          extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich history and
          majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be sure
          not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best
          be prepared for an arduous trek.
        </p>
        <p class="cities__card-paragraph-outro">
          Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers
          on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean,
          which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from for your
          3-month expedition.

          There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in springtime
          New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this
          state is still much less traveled than its neighbors to the South. So
          enjoy it while it lasts.

          You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to
          pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best outdoor
          shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from this
          state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a
          pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for
          unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing through
          the Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes when
          pitching a tent.

          Not only famous for “The Big Apple,” the state of NY also has several
          other reasons for going down in history. Since the late 1800s
          Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,” has been home
          to the world-famous General Electric Company.

          This is where modern power generators were born as well as

          the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle
          to help you see through those dark lonely roads on your adventure.
          Such a light from GE will set you back about $10-20.

          Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,” although
          it can be from time to time, is another town worth passing through for
          several different reasons. While it might be most famously known as
          the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during
          the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has produced a rather decent-sized
          Amish community (eerie, huh?)

          The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already
          guessed, can be summed up by using one delicious word: chocolate.
          Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, one of the
          tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find
          an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the National Wildlife Refuge on
          your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!

          From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of
          Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are surprisingly
          common in this particular region of North America, over 200 of which
          have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However,
          earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking this centrally located
          state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks is
          waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be
          one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you
          can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many roller
          coasters as you can before continue your bike ride!
